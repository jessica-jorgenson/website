  designation : "PROFESSIONAL COLLEAGUE/COLLEGE CLASSMATE"
  content : "Jessica brightens a room anytime she walks in. In my time working with her, she’s never one to shy away from work, and makes sure everyone is working relatively the same amount towards our product. In a group dynamic, she fits well as either the leader or one of the other group members, but either way, she makes sure people are doing okay emotionally, as she cares very much about her friends and coworkers. Her best problem solving quality is her persistence, as she consistently keeps tackling the problem until she finds some sort of solution. I could see her easily being a big addition to a company’s projects as a professional and personal powerhouse."

  content : "Individuals who exemplify leadership, problem-solving, team-building, and optimism are hard to find, unless you've met Jessica Jorgenson. During my class, I would often observe Jessica helping her classmates work through various programming lessons. She was, without exception, the first to volunteer for challenging projects and collaborations as well as take on a leadership and mentor role within the Gallatin Girls Coding Club. I miss having her positivity and brain power in my class."
