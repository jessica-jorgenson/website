As part of the interview process with Tadpull of Bozeman, I was tasked with creating an overview page for products given a JSON file of items to display.


#### Project Details

I used Django/Python, SQL, and HTML/CSS to build this overview page displaying product details, including: Price, Image, Name, Category, InventoryCount, QuantityAvailable, and
UniqueId. To see this page, clone the repository in the Project Link, cd into TadpullChallenge, and run "python manage.py runserver". It's not perfect, but gets the point across.
