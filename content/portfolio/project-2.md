In my last semester at Montana State, I worked with Jamie Winter in our UX class to design an application for connecting people who play video games with other gamers.


#### Project Details

We went through the process of interviewing gamers about what they would want out of an application like this, design empathy maps, personas, and business models. We moved onto mind maps, and a prototype via Adobe XD, and have participants test to see how they would interact with our application. For more detailed information, click the Project Link.
